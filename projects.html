  <h1 id="main-title8">My first project</h2><p class="thurlst"> was a user interface that I created with some friends at CodeRED: Artemis. It was coded in Java. It has two tabs: a
    safety manual and a short quiz to take after you read it. The quiz consists of four multiple-choice questions regarding information that was on the safety manual and after you take it, it will give you a score.</p></p>
  <p><h1 id="main-title3">My second project</h2>
  <p class="thurlste">was a simple booking simulation that I had to make as a school project. I made it in my Intro to C++ course. A user
    enters a date or dates to book a property for. It marks the booking on a calendar. If it's open, it marks those days
    on the calendar. If not, it throws an error.</p>
  <p><h1 id="main-title4">My third project</h2>
  <p class="thurlsty">was the final project I had to make for my Intro to C++ course. The user spawns a pet by typing in a line of code.
    They then have to do things with the pet i.e. walk it. This will reduce it's hunger and make it more tired. If it
    gets too hungry or too tired, the console will output a message to remind you to feed your pet or put it to sleep.
  </p></p>
  <p><h1 id="main-title7">My fourth project</h2>
  <p class="thurlst7">was a website that I led a team for. It was made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We made a website to showcase all
    the team members and showcase a university meeting and dating application that a seperate sub-team was working on.
  </p></p>
  <p><h1 id="main-title6">My fifth project</h2>
  <p class="thurlst6">was this website</p></p>
  <p><h1 id="main-title5">My sixth project</h1>
  <p class="thurlst5">is a game that was coded in Java. A tourist on a strange planet has to run 2-dimensionally across a strange planet,
    picking up weapons along the way to fend off alien attackers. Each weapon can only be used once. The objective is to
    make it to the finish line.</p></p>
