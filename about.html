  <p>
I’m Vishruth Kodikanti, but you can call me Vishu. I have a strong passion for math and computer science. I am active in many organizations, both in school and outside of school. I enjoy them because I get to have fun and meet new people. I am also in The Honors College at UH, where I talk and write about my views on life and listen to other people’s thoughts. It is really fun and enlightening to do this. I also get to make a lot of friends this way. I like traveling, music, animals, and watching tv shows, videos, and movies. I like playing games, being social, and talking to others.</p>
